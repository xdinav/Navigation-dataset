### Improving GNSS/IMU/LiDAR fusion positioning using adaptive LiDAR keyframe selection and refined IMU preintegration

This repository is the usage page of the [Navigation-Dataset](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Qc3cgB_Pm2_B9YVyhkJkWg)（ 0ddp ）. The demand for real-time high-precision location services by humans is increasing day by day. In complex environments such as urban canyons, shaded roads, and overpasses, even multi frequency and multi system GNSS fusion processing cannot ensure continuous and reliable positioning. The Navigation dataset aims to provide a challenging data source for communities (LiDAR GNSS IMU) to further accelerate research on accurate and robust positioning in challenging urban canyons.
